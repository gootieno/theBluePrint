# theBluePrint

Hi! And welcome to theBluePrint! This application is inspired by the love of cars. A place where one can organize their dream car build and document every step of the way. As an owner of a 1994 Mitsubishi 3000gt, I understand the stuggles of finding good write ups on how to fix an issue with a car. Now there is a place where you can not only document your own repairs and upgrades but store them in a time capsule worth revisiting when working on that dream car in the future. 

Stay tuned for the live site:
